# SUMMA

## Inspiration
The main inspiration for the idea was my own personal experience of conducting online learning, where  2-hour long lecture videos would be uploaded. The process of having to watch those lectures takes up time and I usually fall behind on the notes. This website solves this problem.

## What it does
SUMA is a website designed for students to upload their lecture videos and SUMA will create a summary out of it. This process eliminates the need for students to manually take notes.

## How we built it
The front end of the website was built using React. The server is hosted on [server]. I mostly used React for the frontend part of the project, and Python for the API endpoints on the backend.

## Challenges we ran into
This was the first time that I created a website that uses APIs. Prior to this, I don't know how to coordinate and use the API

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
I am extremely proud of the speech-to-text commands that we integrated and using OpenAPI's API to create the summary out of the lectures.

## What we learned
The main concept we learned was how to build an end-to-end application. From this project, I mainly learned how to use OpenAI's APIs to create a summary generator. I also learned that testing is a big part of our project and with dedication and hard work, anything is possible.

## What's next for SUMMA
SUMMA has the potential to aid students' learning experiences. Some of the next features that I want to incorporate is the ability to generate questions (quizzes) to help students review their materials on top of the summary that has been generated.

## How to run the file?
type in 'npm start' in your terminal and it will run the app in the development mode.
